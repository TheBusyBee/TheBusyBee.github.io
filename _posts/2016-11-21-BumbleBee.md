BioNex Solutions is pleased to announce that the US Patent Office has granted us a patent for our BumbleBee Sample Handler. The patent embodies the unique properties of the BumbleBee where microplate carriers and pipettors move independently and simultaneously from each other on multiple axes. This exclusive design provides unprecedented speed and versatility in liquid handling and material transfer operations, allowing the BumbleBee to easily automate the most complex sample transfer applications.
